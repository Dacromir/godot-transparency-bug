# Godot Transparency Bug
This bug is experienced on Godot 3.2.2 stable. The file includes a large csg box, a grid of small csg spheres, and a simple mouse-controlled player that can be controlled with WASD and mouse look.

When moving around and rotating the camera, some of the spheres seem to render in front of the box when they should be inside or behind it.
